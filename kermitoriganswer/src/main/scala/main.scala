//  Comment: Great work! All tests passing successfully.
//  Enums not used for directions, this would have been much better instead of hardcoding them as strings.
//  Could have used the Cell class more for example "currentLocation" doesn't need to be an Array.
//  Careful with mixing Java syntax like using the "new" keyword.
//  Avoid using ‘return’ — refactor the method to have only one exit point.
//  Add some spacing between your methods for better readability.
